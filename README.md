## Reative Programming

This is a demonstration of some basic concepts of reactive programming using RxJS.

To get started, open two terminal windows/tabs. In the first terminal, run the following commands:
```
git checkout 00-setup-env
npm start
```
After a few seconds, you should be able to see your browser starting up and showing "It works!".

Now go to the second terminal, and run `git tag` to see all available examples. You can experiment with each example by running `git checkout <example-tag-name>`. Your browser should be automatically refreshed after that and everytime you save changes to the files in src/ directory.
